== Description ==
iONE360 is a visual product configurator which can handle any type of mass-customizable product regardless of industry, size and complexity. Users can create configurations themselves and can add 3D assets, which is then translated to an easy step-by-step guided selling process that can be embedded in other applications. 

Companies can now offer their configurable/customizable products on all channels consistently; providing (3D) product configuration on webshops, AR, VR and even a roomplanner. All from one single source. Purchases are translated to required SKU information needed to connect to sales, purchasing and logistics to eliminate wrong orders.

Now, even consumers can customize complex products without mistakes and can properly see products before making expensive purchases. Sales value goes up and delivered products will match expectations, which means: less returns, less waste and happy customers!

Features

    - This same plugin can be switched to production mode, so no further work required! 
    - Allows for products to be configurable in 3D. When products are defined as configurable in Magento, a reference SKU to the iONE360 backend can be added. This serves as an input parameter to make sure the right product is loaded in the configurator on your product page.
    - The iONE360 plugin features a fully interactive 3D scene for the product to be viewed from all angles and configured through a guided selling process.
    - Includes a separate component which lists all options and selections made by the end-user, which also serves as the main interface for users to modify options on the product.
    - The plugin includes a fully functional add to cart feature which can add the product, as configured, to the cart including all selections made as well as the correct price (as configured).
    - Fully responsive, mobile friendly. 
    - Contains "full screen mode"
    - Runs on any device, in any browser
